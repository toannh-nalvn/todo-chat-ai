# Research Findings: Collapsible Sidebar

**Feature Branch**: `002-collapsible-sidebar`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Complete  
**Feature Spec**: /Users/toannh/projects/lap-trinh-voi-ai/homework03/specs/002-collapsible-sidebar/spec.md

## Research Tasks

- No specific research tasks were required as the technical stack and requirements were clearly defined in the feature specification and align with the existing project setup.

## Research Findings

- **Decision**: Proceed with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and `shadcn/ui` for the implementation of the Collapsible Sidebar.
- **Rationale**: These technologies are already established in the project and meet all functional and technical constraints outlined in the feature specification. No new or unfamiliar technologies are being introduced that would require extensive research.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the project's technology stack is predefined and suitable for the feature.
